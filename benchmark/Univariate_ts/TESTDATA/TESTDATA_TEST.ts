#The arrowhead data consists of outlines of the images of
#arrowheads. The shapes of the projectile points are converted into
#a time series using the angle-based method. The classification of
#projectile points is is an <a

#topic in anthropology</a>. The classes are based on shape
#distinctions, such as the presence and location of a notch in the
#arrow. The problem in the repository is a length normalised version
#of that used in Ye09shapelets. The three classes are called
#"Avonlea", "Clovis" and "Mix".
